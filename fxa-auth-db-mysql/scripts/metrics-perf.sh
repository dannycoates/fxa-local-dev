# This script runs the auth-server load tests in two sets of five.
# The first set are presented as benchmark times. The second set are
# executed concurrently with the (serially-repeated) metrics queries.
# The sets are of five so that we can discard outliers and compare
# the median value from each. You should bump up the value of COUNT
# to a bigger odd number if it looks like the distribution of results
# warrants it.
#
# Usage: scripts/metrics-perf.sh <load-test path> <metrics.conf path>
#
# Example: scripts/metrics-perf.sh ~/code/fxa-auth-server/test/load ~/fxa-metrics.conf
#
# For the format of metrics.conf, see:
#
# https://github.com/mozilla-services/puppet-config/blob/master/fxa/modules/fxa_admin/templates/gather_basic_metrics.conf.erb
