## A demo of Persona

Mozilla Persona is a distributed authentication system for the web
that lets users sign on using their existing email address without
per-site usernames and passwords.  It's open, free, will become a
standard, and is rigorously supported by the non-profit organziation
that strives to make the web better for the humans that use it. 

This repository contains a demonstration of persona written in HTML
and node.js.
